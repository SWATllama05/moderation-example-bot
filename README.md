Setting Up Your Bot! ðŸŒŸ

1. First you need to make your bot in the discord developer portal, you can do this by going to this link. discord.com/developers/applications

2. Next press "New Application" and give your bot a name, now you will be in the general information section. 

3. Click into the section that says Bot and press "Add Bot" Once you have done that, copy your bot token and paste it in at the bottom of the main.js file where it says client.login('YOUR TOKEN HERE') Replace "your token here" with your discord bot token that you have copied. You also need to add your prefix the the .env file!

4. Copy your client ID which can be found in the General Information section and then go to this link (https://discordapi.com/permissions.html) and make a invite. You only need to select the "Administrator" box.

5. Add this bot to your server by clicking the link that you have made, and authorize your bot to your server.

6. Now you need to start the bot by typing "node ." into your command promt or terminal.
